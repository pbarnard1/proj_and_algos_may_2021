# Singly Linked Lists (SLLs)

## Briefly discuss/review OOP (object-oriented programming)
- How to define a class in JavaScript; refresher from Python and Java
```js
class MyClass {
    constructor(val) {
        this.fieldName = val;
        this.field2 = null;
        this.field3 = false;
    }
}

var x = new MyClass(5); // Example of making an instance of that class
// Displaying the field values for this instance
console.log(x.fieldName);
console.log(x.field2);
console.log(x.field3);
```
Java equivalent:
```java
public class ClassName {
    private int myNumber;

    public ClassName(int number) { // Constructor
        this.myNumber = number;
    }
}

ClassName example = new ClassName(5); // Instance of class
```

Python equivalent:
```py
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, number):
        self.number = number

person = MyClass(5) # Instance of class
```

## When would one want to use a linked list?

- When you want to traverse through items in order, like a photo album, a playlist, etc.
- In a technical interview!  Can you build your own?  

## General structure of a linked list in code
- Define a Node class
- Define a SLL class
- How to add methods that belong to your SLL class

Linked lists will start with a pointer to the head node.  Each node will contain a value and a pointer to the next node.

You can build all types of lists and add more properties to do other stuff!  You can even build other data structures with your custom-defined nodes as you see fit, such as stacks, queues, doubly linked lists, and more!
